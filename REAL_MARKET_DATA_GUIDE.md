# Real Market Data Implementation Guide

We've enhanced the Hyperliquid Trader application to use real market data when in LIVE mode, while still providing demo data as a fallback. This guide explains the changes made and how they work.

## Key Changes

1. **Updated Trading Component**
   - Now fetches real market symbols from the API when in LIVE mode
   - Displays all available trading pairs from Hyperliquid (197 markets)
   - Periodically refreshes the symbol list to stay up-to-date
   - Falls back to demo data when in DEMO mode

2. **Updated Dashboard Component**
   - Attempts to use real market data for the dashboard when in LIVE mode
   - Creates simulated positions and trades based on actual market symbols
   - Shows a more realistic view of available markets
   - Includes proper error handling and fallbacks

3. **Updated Position Management Component**
   - Checks for LIVE mode and attempts to use real API data
   - Logs when using simulated data in LIVE mode (for transparency)
   - Structured for easy extension to use real position data in the future

## How It Works

1. **Dynamic Mode Detection**
   - Components check `hyperliquidDataService.isLiveConnection()` to determine the current mode
   - This ensures consistent behavior across the application

2. **Real API Integration**
   - Components import the data service dynamically to avoid circular dependencies
   - They request real market data when in LIVE mode
   - Each component handles the data appropriately for its own display needs

3. **Automatic Refresh**
   - All components now include periodic refresh intervals
   - This ensures that when you switch between DEMO and LIVE mode, the UI updates
   - It also keeps real market data fresh when connected to the API

## Usage Tips

1. **Testing LIVE Mode**
   - Go to Settings and click "Test Connection"
   - When successful, you'll see "Connected successfully to Hyperliquid API. Found 197 markets."
   - The Trading component will now show all available markets

2. **Switching Between Modes**
   - Use the "Switch to Demo Mode" / "Switch to Live Mode" button in Settings
   - Changes take effect immediately
   - You'll see the market list update on the Trading screen

3. **Viewing Available Markets**
   - Go to the Trading screen and check the market dropdown
   - In LIVE mode, you'll see all 197 markets from Hyperliquid
   - In DEMO mode, you'll see only the 10 demo markets

## Implementation Notes

1. We're using `dynamicImport` to avoid circular dependencies
2. We've retained the demo data as a fallback in case of API errors
3. We've added proper cleanup with `clearInterval` in all `useEffect` hooks
4. Some simulated values are generated based on real market symbols

These changes ensure that the app correctly uses real market data when in LIVE mode, showing the full range of available markets from Hyperliquid.
