Subject: [PATCH] Fix demo mode toggle functionality

This patch fixes the issue with the app always showing demo data even when live mode is selected.
The bug was in the Settings.js file where it tried to call a non-existent method `disableDemoMode()`.
The correct method to use is `enableLiveMode()`.
