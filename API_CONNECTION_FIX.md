# Fixed API Connection and Mode Switching Issues

We've fixed the issues with the API connection and mode switching in the Hyperliquid Trader application.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated API Endpoints
- Changed from `info/meta` to the correct endpoint `info/getMetaAndAssetCtxs`
- Updated all API calls to use direct fetch() instead of the wrapper method
- Ensured correct headers and request format

### 2. Improved Demo/Live Mode Handling
- Added proper cleanup of demo data intervals when switching modes
- Added an `isDemoActive()` helper method to accurately check current state
- Updated `isLiveConnection()` to use the correct status indicator
- Added regular status checks to keep the UI in sync

### 3. Enhanced Settings UI
- Added status updates when switching modes
- Added a success message when switching to demo mode
- Implemented a status polling interval to keep indicators up to date

### 4. Fixed Initialization Logic
- The app now properly checks the API connection on startup
- It automatically falls back to demo mode if the API is unreachable
- It ensures demo data is generated when in demo mode

## How to Use

1. Pull the latest changes from GitHub
2. Start the application using the run-app-safe.bat script
3. Go to Settings and try the Test Connection button
4. Use the Switch to Demo/Live Mode button to toggle between modes

## Common Issues

- **404 Not Found Error**: This should be resolved by the endpoint updates
- **Demo Data in Live Mode**: This is fixed by properly clearing demo intervals and checking status
- **UI Not Reflecting Actual State**: Fixed with regular status polling

The app should now correctly show when you're in demo vs. live mode, and the demo data should stop when switching to live mode (and vice versa).
