# Fixed Hyperliquid API Connection

We've resolved the "API request failed: API request failed with status 404: Not Found" error by updating the API implementation to use the correct Hyperliquid API endpoints.

## Key Changes

1. **Updated API Endpoint Format**:
   - Changed from using `/info/getMetaAndAssetCtxs` (which doesn't exist) to the correct endpoints
   - Added support for two Hyperliquid API formats:
     - POST to `/info` with body `{"type": "meta"}` for market data
     - GET to `/exchange/v1/all_mids` for exchange data

2. **Improved Error Handling**:
   - Added fallback between multiple endpoint formats
   - Better error handling and logging
   - Graceful fallback to demo mode when API requests fail

3. **Enhanced Initialization**:
   - Now tries both API formats during initialization
   - More resilient connection testing
   - Properly cleans up demo mode when live connection is established

## How to Use

1. Pull the latest changes from GitHub
2. Start the application
3. Go to Settings and click "Test Connection"
4. The application should now successfully connect to the Hyperliquid API

## Why This Works

The Hyperliquid API has a specific format that we were not using correctly:
1. For market data, we need to use a POST request to `/info` with a JSON body
2. For exchange data, we can use a GET request to `/exchange/v1/all_mids`

Our previous approach was using incorrect endpoint paths, resulting in 404 errors.

This update makes the application compatible with the actual Hyperliquid API structure.
