# Complete Fix for Demo Mode Issues

This is a complete fix for the issues with the application not switching from demo mode to live mode. The previous fix only addressed part of the problem.

## The Issues

1. Missing `disableDemoMode()` method in the hyperliquidDataService
   - This method is called from multiple places but wasn't implemented
   - Settings.js tried to call it when switching modes
   - testConnection also tried to use it for testing API connection

2. Incomplete implementation of `enableLiveMode()` method
   - It wasn't stopping the demo data simulations
   - It wasn't forcing a reload of market data after mode change

## The Fix

These changes add a proper implementation of the missing method and improve the existing one:

1. Added a new `disableDemoMode()` method that calls `enableLiveMode()`
2. Enhanced `enableLiveMode()` to:
   - Stop all demo simulations
   - Set the mode to LIVE
   - Force reload market and account data

## Files to Modify

You need to edit the `frontend/src/services/hyperliquidDataService.js` file:

1. Add the `disableDemoMode()` method (around line 1240):
```javascript
/**
 * Disable demo mode and switch to live API
 */
disableDemoMode() {
  return this.enableLiveMode();
}
```

2. Enhance the `enableLiveMode()` method (around line 1250):
```javascript
// Stop all demo simulations
this._stopAllSimulations();

// Set mode to LIVE - this will trigger connection to real API
this._setMode(API_MODES.LIVE);

// Force reload market and account data
this._loadData();
```

After making these changes, restart the application and try switching between demo and live modes from the Settings page.
