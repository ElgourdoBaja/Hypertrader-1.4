```
ERROR: Incorrect locale information provided
RangeError: Incorrect locale information provided
  at Date.toLocaleString (<anonymous>)

```

This error occurs in multiple chart-related functions and prevents proper chart rendering. The error overlay also affects navigation within the application.

### Mock electronAPI Implementation

The mock electronAPI implementation for web-based testing is working correctly. The application successfully uses localStorage for credential storage when electronAPI is not available.

## Recommendations

1. **Fix Chart Rendering Issue**: The locale-related errors in the chart rendering need to be fixed. This could involve:
   - Setting a default locale for the chart library
   - Handling locale errors gracefully
   - Updating the chart library to a version that handles locale issues better

2. **Improve Error Handling**: The application should handle chart rendering errors more gracefully without blocking the entire UI with an error overlay.

3. **Enhance Navigation**: Ensure that navigation works correctly even when there are rendering issues in specific components.

## Conclusion

The Hyperliquid high-frequency trading application is mostly functional with a fully working backend API and most UI components rendering properly. However, there's a significant issue with chart rendering in the trading page due to locale-related errors that affects the user experience and navigation. This issue was previously reported and still exists.
